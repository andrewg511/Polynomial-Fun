# Polynomial-Fun
In this tool, you can Add, Multiply, or Evaluate polynomials. This program requires you to input a text file containing the polynomial. 

Please fell free to learn from this code but DO NOT copy the code completely. Doing so may be considered plagerism.

Also, I only coded the "Polynomial" file, all the other code is written by Rutgers staff
